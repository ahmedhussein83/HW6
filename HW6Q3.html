3. Which of the following statements will potentially execute? And give values for A, B and C that will make the statement execute:
    5.1. if (A is true AND B is true) OR (A is false AND B is true) THEN color="blue"
    5.2. if (A is true AND B is false) OR (A is NOT true AND A is false) THEN color="green"
    5.3. if (A is true AND B is false OR A is false) OR (A is either true or false) THEN color="yellow"
    5.4. if (false AND true) OR (false OR true) THEN color="white"

Answre:
5.1. if (A is true AND B is true) OR (A is false AND B is true) THEN color="blue" (this statement is execute)
because the values for A AND B are true OR the value for A is false AND B is true.
5.2. if (A is true AND B is false) OR (A is NOT true AND A is false) THEN color="green" 
(this statement is execute) because the values for A is true AND the value for B is false OR 
the value for A is false.
5.3. if (A is true AND B is false OR A is false) OR (A is either true or false) THEN color="yellow" 
(this statement is not execute) because the values for (A is true AND B is false) statement number 5.2.
5.4. if (A is false AND B is true) OR (A is false OR B is true) THEN color="white" 
(this statement is not execute) because the values for (A is false AND B is true) statement number 5.1.
