2. Which of the following statements will potentially execute? And give values for A, B and C that will make the statement execute:
    if A is true OR A is false OR B is true OR C is true THEN color="blue"
    else if A is true OR B is false OR C is false THEN color="red"
    else if A is true OR B is false OR C is true THEN color="green"
    else color="yellow"
Answer:
if A is true OR A is false OR B is true OR C is true THEN color="blue"
(this statement is execute).
else if A is true OR B is false OR C is false THEN color="red" (this statement is not execute) because the 
value for A is true that means the color=“blue” (first statement).
else if A is true OR B is false OR C is true THEN color="green" (this statement is not execute)because the 
value for A is true that means the color=“blue” (first statement).
else color="yellow" (this statement is not execute) because the values for A it is either true OR false will give us color="blue"
the first statement.
