1. Which of the following statements will potentially execute? And give values for A, B and C that will make the statement execute:
    if A is true AND B is true AND C is true THEN color="blue"
    else if A is true AND B is false AND C is false THEN color="red"
    else if A is true AND A is false THEN color="orange"
    else if A is true AND B is false AND C is true THEN color="green"
    else color="yellow"
Answer:
If A is true AND B is true AND C is true THEN color=”blue” (this statement is execute) because the 
values for A,B and C are TRUE.
else if A is true AND B is false AND C is false THEN color="red" (this statement is execute)
because the values for A is true AND B,C are false.
else if A is true AND A is false THEN color="orange" (this statement is not execute) because of A has diffrent values.
else if A is true AND B is false AND C is true THEN color="green" (this statement is execute) 
because the values for A is TRUE and B is false and C is TRUE.
Else if A is false AND B is false AND C is false THEN color=”yellow” (this statement is execute) 
because the values for A,B and C are FALSE.
